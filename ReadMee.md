In this assignment, I learned how to import pandas, upload csv and excel files, and use programming language to query the animals and billionaires databases. I could also plot within the Jupyter Notebook, which is nice. 


I found out that pandas is much easier than Python (no more for loops!), but I do see why Soma needed to teach Python first. 


I think I’m still a bit confused about whether I created a new dataframe with a subset of data or not. 


I need to go through the “coffee sales” in-class exercise again. I think that will help me solidify what I’ve learned.
